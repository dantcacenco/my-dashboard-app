## 📝 **To Delete Fake Jobs**

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run this SQL (BE CAREFUL!):

```sql
DELETE FROM jobs 
WHERE title IN ('Furnace Repair - Danny', 'HVAC System Installation - Danny', 
                'Emergency AC Repair - Danny', 'Annual Maintenance - Danny')
   OR title LIKE '%Danny%';
```

Or to see what will be deleted first:
```sql
SELECT id, job_number, title FROM jobs 
WHERE title LIKE '%Danny%' OR title LIKE '%Furnace%' OR title LIKE '%HVAC%';
```
