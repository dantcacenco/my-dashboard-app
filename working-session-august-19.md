## üéØ **Today's Completed Fixes**

### ‚úÖ **1. Send to Customer Button Restored**
- **Issue**: Button disappeared from proposal admin view
- **Location**: Next to Edit and Print buttons on proposal detail page
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated ProposalView.tsx to show SendProposal component for draft/sent status
  - Fixed props passing (proposalId, customerEmail, customerName, proposalNumber)
  - Modal with editable email subject/body working
  - Customer receives email with token-based proposal link via Resend API
  - Token link allows viewing without login
  - Email sent through `/api/send-proposal` endpoint using Resend

### ‚úÖ **2. Technician Management Fixed**
- **Issue**: Refresh button didn't update list, required manual page refresh
- **Solution**:
  - Updated TechniciansClientView to use client-side Supabase queries
  - Refresh button now fetches fresh data and updates state
  - New technicians appear immediately after adding
  - Edit and delete functionality maintained

### ‚úÖ **3. Jobs Tab Comprehensive Update**
- **Overview Tab**: 
  - Editable with inline editing
  - Save/Cancel buttons
  - Persists to database
  
- **Assigned Technicians Tab**:
  - Dropdown populated with all active technicians from database
  - Multiple technician assignment supported
  - Easy removal with X button
  - Real-time updates to technician dashboards
  
- **Photos Tab**:
  - Upload functionality connected to Supabase storage
  - Uses `job-photos` bucket
  - Images display in grid layout
  - Stores metadata in job_photos table
  
- **Files Tab**:
  - Upload any file type to Supabase storage
  - Uses `job-files` bucket
  - Download links for uploaded files
  - Stores metadata in job_files table
  
- **Notes Tab**:
  - Editable text area
  - Save functionality
  - Persists to jobs.notes field

### ‚úÖ **4. Edit Job Modal**

  - Job details (title, type, status)
  - Service location fields (address, city, state, zip)
  - Scheduled date and time
  - Overview text area
  - Notes text area
- Updates both job and customer records when saved

### ‚úÖ **5. Create Job from Proposal**
- **Location**: Black button with white text next to Edit/Print
- **Conditions**: Shows only for approved proposals that haven't created a job yet
- **Functionality**:
  - Creates job with status "not_scheduled"
  - Links to proposal via proposal_id
  - Copies customer info and service address
  - Auto-generates job number (JOB-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
  - Marks proposal.job_created = true
  - Redirects to new job detail page

## üìä **Database Schema Updates Used**

### **Key Tables & Relationships**
```sql
-- Jobs table has these fields we're using:
- job_number (auto-generated)
- customer_id (FK to customers)
- proposal_id (FK to proposals)
- title, description, notes
- job_type (installation, repair, maintenance, inspection)
- status (not_scheduled, scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- service_address, service_city, service_state, service_zip
- scheduled_date, scheduled_time

-- Job-related tables:
- job_technicians (many-to-many relationship)
- job_photos (photo metadata and URLs)
- job_files (file metadata and URLs)
- job_materials (equipment tracking)
- job_activity_log (audit trail)
- job_time_entries (time tracking with GPS)

-- Proposals table:
- job_created (boolean flag to prevent duplicate jobs)
- customer_view_token (UUID for customer portal access)
```

### **Supabase Storage Buckets**
- `job-photos` (public) - For job photo uploads
- `job-files` (private) - For document uploads
- `task-photos` (public) - For task-related photos

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Email System - Resend**
- Using Resend API for transactional emails
- Configured with `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
- Emails sent through `/api/send-proposal` endpoint
- Supports HTML email templates
- Handles proposal sending and approval notifications

### **File Upload Pattern**
```typescript
// Standard pattern for file uploads to Supabase
const fileName = `${job.id}/${Date.now()}_${file.name}`
const { error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('bucket-name')
  .upload(fileName, file)
const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('bucket-name')
  .getPublicUrl(fileName)
```

### **Component Structure**
- `ProposalView.tsx` - Main proposal display with Send button
- `SendProposal.tsx` - Reusable email sending component (uses Resend)
- `CreateJobButton.tsx` - Job creation from proposal
- `JobDetailView.tsx` - Comprehensive job management interface
- `TechniciansClientView.tsx` - Technician list with refresh

### **Key Patterns**
- All modals use fixed positioning with z-50
- Consistent use of toast notifications for user feedback
- Client-side state management with useState
- Real-time data refresh using Supabase client
- Role-based visibility (boss/admin can edit, technicians view only)

## üö® **Known Issues & Next Steps**

### **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ All requested features working
- ‚úÖ Build passing (warnings are just missing local env vars)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Deployed to GitHub main branch

### **Testing Needed**
1. Test Send to Customer email delivery via Resend
2. Verify customer can view proposal with token link
3. Test payment flow (50% deposit, 30% rough-in, 20% final)
4. Verify file upload size limits
5. Test technician portal job visibility

### **Potential Enhancements**
- Add drag-and-drop for file uploads
- Image compression before upload
- Bulk technician assignment
- Job templates from previous jobs
- Email template management in Resend
- SMS notifications for technicians

## üí° **Important Notes for Next Session**

### **Authentication Context**
- User role is `boss` not `admin`
- Always check for both roles in conditionals
- RLS is enabled on all tables

### **UI Patterns to Maintain**
- Buttons: consistent styling with shadcn/ui
- Modals: fixed position, dark overlay, z-50
- Forms: proper labels, error handling
- Tables: hover states, action buttons
- Status badges: color-coded with icons

### **Development Workflow**
- Always use `update-script.sh` for deployments
- Test in incognito/private browser
- Single .sh file solutions preferred
- Complete file replacements, no sed/grep for complex changes
- Commit messages should be descriptive

### **Environment Variables (Set in Vercel)**
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- RESEND_API_KEY (for Resend email service)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (for absolute URLs in emails)
