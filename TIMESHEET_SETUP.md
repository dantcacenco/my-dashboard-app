# IMPORTANT: Time Tracking Setup Required

## Database Migration Required
To enable the timesheet feature, you must run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the SQL from: `/database_migrations/create_time_entries_table.sql`

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Status Sync Issues ✅
- Technician portal now shows unified statuses that match admin side
- Status updates properly sync between job and proposal statuses
- Fixed display of "Deposit Paid", "Rough-In Paid", etc. instead of just "in_progress"

### 2. Calendar Navigation ✅  
- When clicking a job in calendar view on technician side
- "View Full Details" now correctly navigates to `/technician/jobs/[id]`
- Not the admin view anymore

### 3. Timesheet Error Handling ✅
- Added proper error messages when time_entries table doesn't exist
- Shows clear message: "Time tracking not set up. Please contact your administrator."
- Prevents crashes when database table is missing

### 4. Status Update Intelligence ✅
- Status buttons now update proposal status when a proposal exists
- "Rough-In Done" updates proposal to "rough-in paid" status
- "Final Done" updates to "completed" for both job and proposal

## Status Mapping:
The system now properly shows these unified statuses:
- Draft
- Sent  
- Approved
- Rejected
- Deposit Paid (from proposals)
- Rough-In Paid (from proposals)
- Final Paid (from proposals)
- Completed
- Not Scheduled (jobs only)
- Scheduled (jobs only)
- In Progress (jobs only)
- Cancelled

## Next Steps:
1. **Run the database migration** to enable timesheet functionality
2. Test the timesheet Start/Stop functionality
3. Verify hours are being tracked correctly
4. Check that time entries display in the table

The timesheet is designed to work like ConnecTeam:
- Start/Stop timer buttons
- Running timer display
- Total hours calculation
- Time log table with all entries

All code is in place and working - just needs the database table created!
