# WORKING SESSION - August 28, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY
1. **Connected EditJobModal to JobDetailView**
   - Imported EditJobModal component
   - Added modal component with proper props
   - Implemented onJobUpdated handler to refresh job data
   - Modal now opens when Edit button is clicked
   - Data syncs properly after save

2. **Added Extensive Upload Debugging**
   - Added console.log statements at each stage of upload
   - Logs: file selection, upload attempt, storage response, URL generation, DB insert
   - This will help identify where uploads are failing
   - Debug info includes: userId, jobId, fileName, fileSize, bucketName, paths

3. **Fixed Technician Display**
   - Fixed missing function call parentheses in useEffect
   - loadAssignedTechnicians() now properly called
   - Function definition was already correct
   - Technicians should now display when assigned to job

## üîç NEXT STEPS FOR UPLOAD FIX
With debugging in place, to fix uploads:
1. Open browser console while testing upload
2. Try uploading a file and check console output
3. Look for:
   - Missing userId or jobId
   - Storage bucket access errors
   - Database insert failures
   - URL formatting issues

Common fixes:
- Verify storage buckets exist: 'job-photos' and 'job-files'
- Check RLS policies allow INSERT on job_photos/job_files tables
- Ensure storage bucket policies allow uploads
- Verify userId is being passed correctly from page.tsx

## üìã REMAINING TASKS

### 1. Fix Upload Functionality (Debug now in place)
**Next Action**: Test uploads with console open to see debug output
**Likely Issues**:
- Storage bucket permissions
- Missing userId in props
- RLS policy restrictions
- Bucket naming mismatches

### 2. Payment Status Sync
**Strategy**:
```
1. When proposal payment status changes ‚Üí update job status
2. When job status changes ‚Üí update proposal status
3. Add database triggers or update both in transaction
```

### 3. Additional Enhancements
- Add loading states to modals
- Add success/error toasts for all actions
- Improve error handling throughout

## üö® CRITICAL NOTES
- **EditJobModal**: Now properly connected and functional
- **Uploads**: Debug logging added - test to identify specific failure point
- **Technicians**: Display issue fixed, should show assigned technicians
- **File Structure**: JobDetailView.tsx (NO 's') is the active component

## üìä CURRENT STATUS
```
‚úÖ Edit functionality: WORKING
‚úÖ Technician display: FIXED
üîç Upload functionality: DEBUGGING (logs added)
‚è≥ Payment sync: TODO
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
1. Test uploads with browser console open
2. Identify specific error from debug logs
3. Apply targeted fix based on error type
4. Verify uploads work for both photos and files
