# WORKING SESSION - August 28, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY
1. **Connected EditJobModal to JobDetailView**
   - Imported EditJobModal component
   - Added modal component with proper props
   - Implemented onJobUpdated handler to refresh job data
   - Modal now opens when Edit button is clicked
   - Data syncs properly after save

2. **Added Extensive Upload Debugging**
   - Added console.log statements at each stage of upload
   - Logs: file selection, upload attempt, storage response, URL generation, DB insert
   - This will help identify where uploads are failing
   - Debug info includes: userId, jobId, fileName, fileSize, bucketName, paths

3. **Fixed Technician Display**
   - Fixed missing function call parentheses in useEffect
   - loadAssignedTechnicians() now properly called
   - Function definition was already correct
   - Technicians should now display when assigned to job

## üî¥ CURRENT CONSOLE ERRORS (NEED IMMEDIATE FIX)

### 1. React Minified Error #418
- **Error**: Hydration mismatch or invalid HTML nesting
- **URL**: https://react.dev/errors/418
- **Action**: Check for invalid HTML structure in JobDetailView

### 2. Missing API Routes (404)
- **Missing**: `/api/invoices/route.ts`
- **Error**: Failed to load invoices endpoint
- **Solution**: Create invoice API route handler

### 3. Duplicate Technician Assignment
- **Error**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "job_technicians_job_id_technician_id_key"`
- **Issue**: Trying to INSERT already assigned technician
- **Fix**: Check existence before INSERT in toggleTechnician function

## üîß QUICK FIXES NEEDED

### Fix 1: Technician Toggle (JobDetailView.tsx)
