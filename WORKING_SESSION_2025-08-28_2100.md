# WORKING SESSION - Service Pro HVAC Management System
**Last Updated:** August 28, 2025  
**Current Version:** 2.1 STABLE  
**Session Focus:** Post-Payment Implementation Planning

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### Payment System Implementation (FULLY WORKING)
The payment system is now fully functional with progressive unlocking. Here's the complete flow:

#### 1. Proposal Email Flow
- **File:** `/app/api/send-proposal/route.ts`
- Creates email with proposal link using `customer_view_token`
- Sends via Resend API to customer email

#### 2. Customer Proposal View
- **File:** `/app/proposal/view/[token]/CustomerProposalView.tsx`
- Customer accesses without login using token
- Shows approve/reject buttons
- After approval, shows payment stages

#### 3. Payment Creation
- **File:** `/app/api/create-payment/route.ts`
- Creates Stripe checkout session
- Includes metadata: proposal_id, payment_stage, proposal_number
- Redirects to Stripe hosted checkout

#### 4. Webhook Processing (CRITICAL)
- **File:** `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- Receives `checkout.session.completed` events from Stripe
- Updates database: deposit_paid_at, progress_paid_at, final_paid_at
- Updates status: "deposit paid", "rough-in paid", "completed"
- **Important:** Removed `payment_stage` field due to database constraint
- **Note:** `payments` table logging is optional (table may not exist)

#### 5. Payment Success Redirect
- **File:** `/app/api/payment-success/route.ts`
- Simple redirect back to proposal view
- Webhook handles actual database updates

#### Key Discoveries:
- Database has CHECK constraint on `payment_stage` field
- Must use exact status values: "deposit paid", "rough-in paid", "completed"
- Webhook secret MUST be configured in Vercel environment variables
- Progressive unlocking works: deposit ‚Üí rough-in ‚Üí final

## üéØ UPCOMING TASKS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

### 1. Admin Dashboard Improvements

#### Remove Metric Boxes
- **Location:** `/app/DashboardContent.tsx`
- **Plan:** Remove the 4 metric cards (Total Proposals, Approved, Conversion Rate, Payment Rate)
- Keep only Calendar and Recent Proposals sections

#### Add Week/Month Toggle to Calendar
- **Location:** `/components/CalendarView.tsx`
- **Current:** Month view only
- **Plan:** 
  - Add toggle button for Week/Month view
  - Week view: 7-day grid showing current week
  - Maintain job click ‚Üí modal functionality
  - Keep status legend at bottom

#### Fix Recent Activities
- **Location:** `/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` and `/app/DashboardContent.tsx`
- **Current Issue:** Shows "No recent activities"
- **Plan:**
  - Query multiple tables for recent events:
    - proposals (created, sent, approved, rejected)
    - payments (deposit paid, rough-in paid, final paid)
    - jobs (status changes)
  - Sort by timestamp, limit to 10 most recent
  - Display with icons and descriptive text

### 2. Bill.com API Integration Planning
- **Current:** Stripe for all payments
- **Target:** Replace with Bill.com API
- **Research Needed:**
  - Bill.com API authentication flow
  - Invoice creation endpoints
  - Payment tracking webhooks
  - Customer management
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - Create new `/api/billcom/` directory
  - Parallel implementation (keep Stripe working)
  - Environment variable for payment provider selection
  - Gradual migration path

### 3. Technician Portal - Calendar View
- **Location:** `/app/(authenticated)/technician/page.tsx`
- **Plan:**
  - Add CalendarView component (reuse from admin)
  - Filter jobs by assigned technician
  - Week/Month toggle same as admin
  - Click job ‚Üí modal with details
  - No other changes to page

### 4. Technician Portal - Time Sheet Feature
- **Location:** `/app/(authenticated)/technician/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Current:** "Update Job Status" box
- **Plan:**
  - Rename to "Time Sheet"
  - Button states: "Start" ‚Üî "Stop"
  - Database schema needed:
    ```sql
    time_entries table:
    - id
    - job_id
    - technician_id
    - start_time
    - end_time
    - created_at
    ```
  - Display log of all entries in table format
  - Calculate and show total hours
  - Persist state across page refreshes

### 5. Technician Portal - Photo/File Display Fix
- **Location:** `/app/(authenticated)/technician/jobs/[id]/TechnicianJobView.tsx`
- **Issue:** Thumbnails and full images not displaying
- **Plan:**
  - Copy implementation from admin JobDetailView
  - Use same MediaViewer component
  - Fix click handlers for modal display
  - Ensure Supabase storage URLs are correct

### 6. Technician Portal - Notes Improvement
- **Current:** Appends timestamp and "Technician Note:" prefix
- **Target:** Single editable text field like admin side
- **Plan:**
  - Change from append-only to single text field
  - Remove timestamp prefixing
  - Save as single note entry, not comments
  - Match admin Notes implementation

### 7. Technician Portal - Status Updates

  - Add status dropdown with limited options:
    - "Work Started" (NEW - needs to be added system-wide)
    - "Rough-In Done"
    - "Job Started"
    - "Final Done"
    - "Completed"
  - Update both job and proposal tables
  - Trigger status sync functions

### 8. Admin Jobs - Remove "Click filename to view"
