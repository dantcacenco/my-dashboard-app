# WORKING SESSION - August 27, 2025

## ✅ BUILD FIXED - READY FOR WORK
- **Status**: TypeScript builds successfully, SSR warnings are expected locally
- **Vercel**: Will build and deploy correctly (has env vars)
- **Cleaned up**: Removed files that weren't in working commit

## 🔑 CRITICAL INFO
- **Database Password**: cSEX2IYYjeJru6V
- **Project Ref**: dqcxwekmehrqkigcufug
- **Supabase URL**: https://dqcxwekmehrqkigcufug.supabase.co
- **Local Path**: /Users/dantcacenco/Documents/GitHub/my-dashboard-app

## ✅ CURRENT WORKING FEATURES
From commit 04d791e:
- Admin dashboard with revenue metrics
- Proposal creation and management  
- Customer portal (token-based access, no login)
- Job management and assignment to technicians
- Technician portal with job views
- Multi-stage payment (50/30/20 split)
- Calendar views (week/month)
- Photo/file uploads
- Email notifications via Resend

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES TO ADDRESS
1. **Photo thumbnails** - Photos upload but may not display thumbnails
2. **Calendar** - Jobs exist but may need modal for viewing
3. **Storage costs** - Need cheaper solution than Supabase

## 🛠️ SQL ACCESS (Working)
```bash
PGPASSWORD="cSEX2IYYjeJru6V" /opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.10/bin/psql \

  -U "postgres.dqcxwekmehrqkigcufug" -d "postgres" \
  -c "YOUR SQL HERE"
```

## 📝 MAKE STORAGE BUCKETS PUBLIC (if needed)
```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets 
SET public = true 
WHERE name IN ('job-photos', 'job-files');
```
