# Service Pro Field Service Management - Implementation Summary
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Status**: Core features deployed, customer display issue pending

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building a field service management app (like Housecall Pro) for HVAC businesses with:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Proposal → Approval → Payment flow
- Multi-stage payments (50% → 30% → 20%)
- Customer portal without authentication

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Phase 0: Customer Array Access Fixes ✅
- Fixed all instances where code accessed `customers.property` instead of `customers[0]?.property`
- **Key Pattern**: Supabase joins ALWAYS return arrays, even for single relationships

### Phase 1: Customer Authentication Bypass ✅
- Updated `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` to allow public paths:
  - `/proposal/view`
  - `/api/proposal-approval`
  - `/api/create-payment`
  - `/api/stripe/webhook`
  - `/proposal/payment-success`
- Created minimal `app/proposal/layout.tsx` without navigation

### Phase 2: Multi-Stage Payment System ✅
- Created `components/MultiStagePayment.tsx`
- Created `ApprovalForm.tsx` and `RejectionForm.tsx`
- Created `/api/proposal-approval` route
- Updated payment flow to track stages (deposit/progress/final)
- Fixed Stripe webhook to handle payment stages

### Phase 3: Proposals List Updates ✅
- Updated `ProposalsList.tsx` to handle customer array access
- Added proper sorting and filtering

### Phase 4: Dashboard Revenue Tracking ✅
- Updated `DashboardContent.tsx` to use `total_paid` from proposals
- Removed unnecessary metrics

## 🔴 Current Issues

### 1. Customer Display Issue ("No customer")
**Problem**: All proposals show "No customer" in the list  
**Root Cause**: Proposals don't have `customer_id` values linked

**Database Schema Discovery**:
```sql
-- customers table requires:
- created_by (user ID) - NOT NULL
- updated_by (user ID) - can be NULL

-- RLS policies show:
- Anonymous users can only see customers linked to proposals with tokens
- Authenticated users can see all customers
```

**Fix Steps**:
1. Get your user ID:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

2. Create a customer:
```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone, address, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
    'HVAC Test Customer',
    'customer@example.com', 
    '555-0123',
    '456 Oak Street, Anytown, USA',
    'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE', -- Replace with actual ID from step 1
    NOW(),
    NOW()
)
RETURNING id;
```

3. Link proposals to customer:
```sql
UPDATE proposals 
SET customer_id = 'CUSTOMER-ID-FROM-STEP-2'
WHERE customer_id IS NULL;
```

## 🔧 Critical Patterns to Remember

### 1. Supabase Joins Always Return Arrays
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
proposal.customers.name

// ✅ CORRECT
proposal.customers[0]?.name
```

### 2. Database Columns Already Exist
The proposals table already has these payment columns:
- `deposit_paid_at`, `progress_paid_at`, `final_paid_at`
- `deposit_amount`, `progress_amount`, `final_amount`
- `current_payment_stage`
- `total_paid`

### 3. File Structure
```
app/
├── proposal/
│   ├── view/[token]/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   ├── CustomerProposalView.tsx
│   │   ├── ApprovalForm.tsx

## 📝 Deployment Commands Used

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install date-fns
```

### Git Commands Pattern
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Fix Needed
1. Create customers in database with proper user ID
2. Link existing proposals to customers
3. Test customer display on proposals page

### Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
- [ ] Customer creation in proposal form
- [ ] Payment reminder emails
- [ ] Job scheduling system
- [ ] Technician portal
- [ ] Inventory management
- [ ] QuickBooks integration

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Check Vercel Logs
- Build errors usually show TypeScript issues
- Runtime errors appear in Function logs

### Common Build Errors Fixed
1. **Property doesn't exist on type**: Usually means trying to pass props that component doesn't accept
2. **Cannot use .catch() on Supabase query**: Use proper error handling instead
3. **Module not found**: Missing npm packages (like date-fns)

### SQL Queries for Troubleshooting
```sql
-- Check proposals with/without customers
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(customer_id) as with_customers,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(customer_id) as without_customers
FROM proposals;

-- View proposal-customer relationships
SELECT 
    p.proposal_number,
    p.customer_id,
    c.name as customer_name
FROM proposals p
LEFT JOIN customers c ON p.customer_id = c.id
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables Needed
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

- Supabase Dashboard: Check tables, RLS policies, and run SQL
- Vercel Dashboard: Check deployments and logs
- Stripe Dashboard: Verify webhook configuration

## 💡 Important Notes
1. Always check TypeScript compilation with `npm run build` before pushing
2. Test customer view without authentication using incognito window
3. Payment success page already redirects back to proposal view
4. Use lowercase payment stage names (deposit, progress, final)
5. The app is at ~40% of context window capacity as of this summary
