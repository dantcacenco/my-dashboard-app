# Working Session - August 5, 2025
## Service Pro Field Service Management - Build Fixes & Current State

**Status**: Build errors fixed, ready for feature implementation  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, Supabase, Stripe, Vercel  
**Current Branch**: main

---

## üéØ **Today's Completed Fixes**

### ‚úÖ **Build Error Fixes**
1. **SendProposal Props Mismatch**
   - Fixed `ProposalView.tsx` passing incorrect props to `SendProposal`
   - Changed from `proposal={proposal}` to individual props: `proposalId`, `proposalNumber`, `customer`, `total`

2. **ProposalsList Type Consistency**
   - Updated both `proposals/page.tsx` and `ProposalsList.tsx` to use `customers: Customer` (object, not array)
   - Fixed all references from `proposal.customers[0]` to `proposal.customers`
   - Aligns with Supabase behavior: joins return OBJECTS not arrays

3. **Role Check Updates**
   - Changed all role checks from `'boss'` to `'admin'` in:
     - `ProposalView.tsx`
     - `proposals/[id]/page.tsx`
     - `proposals/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
   - Fixed missing action buttons (Edit, Send Proposal, Print)

4. **Dashboard Revenue Calculation**
   - Updated to calculate revenue from multi-stage payments:
     - Counts `deposit_amount` when `deposit_paid_at` is set
     - Counts `progress_amount` when `progress_paid_at` is set
     - Counts `final_amount` when `final_paid_at` is set
   - Fixed dashboard data structure to match `DashboardContent` interface
   - Fixed array transformation logic to prevent nested arrays

## üìä **Current Database Schema**

All multi-stage payment columns are already in the `proposals` table:
- `payment_status`, `payment_method`, `stripe_session_id`
- `deposit_paid_at`, `deposit_amount`
- `progress_paid_at`, `progress_payment_amount` (note: different column name)
- `final_paid_at`, `final_payment_amount` (note: different column name)
- `total_paid`, `payment_stage`, `current_payment_stage`
- `next_payment_due`, `deposit_percentage`, `progress_percentage`, `final_percentage`

---

## üö® **Remaining Priority Tasks**

### **TASK 1: Customer Token-Based Access (No Auth Required)**
**Problem**: Customers must sign in to view proposals  
**Required**: Access via direct link in private/incognito browser without authentication

**Implementation needed**:
- Update `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` to allow public paths for `/proposal/view/[token]`
- Create minimal layout for customer views (no nav bar)
- Ensure RLS policies allow token-based access

### **TASK 2: Multi-Stage Payment System UI**
**Problem**: No UI for multi-stage payments after approval  
**Required**: 3-stage payment interface

**Implementation needed**:
1. Update `CustomerProposalView.tsx` to show payment stages after approval
2. Create payment stage components:
   - 50% Deposit - Active immediately after approval
   - 30% Rough In - Locked until deposit paid
   - 20% Final - Locked until rough in paid
3. Add progress bar showing total paid percentage
4. Update payment success handler to unlock next stage
5. Update Stripe webhook to handle staged payments

---

## üí° **Key Implementation Notes**

### **For Customer Token Access**
```typescript
// In middleware.ts, add to public routes:
const publicRoutes = [
  '/proposal/view/',
  '/proposal/payment-success',
  '/api/proposal-approval',
  '/api/create-payment'
]
```

### **For Multi-Stage Payments**
```typescript
// Payment stages configuration
const PAYMENT_STAGES = {
  deposit: { percentage: 0.5, label: '50% Deposit' },
  progress: { percentage: 0.3, label: '30% Rough In' },
  final: { percentage: 0.2, label: '20% Final' }
}
```

### **Database Column Name Mapping**
Note the inconsistency in column names:
- `deposit_amount` ‚úì
- `progress_payment_amount` (not `progress_amount`)
- `final_payment_amount` (not `final_amount`)

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Test proposal view with admin role
- [ ] Verify Edit, Send, Print buttons appear
- [ ] Check dashboard revenue calculation
- [ ] Test in private/incognito browser for customer access
- [ ] Verify Stripe payment flow

### **Next Steps**
1. Choose which task to implement first
2. Create comprehensive solution script
3. Test thoroughly before pushing
4. Update this document with progress
