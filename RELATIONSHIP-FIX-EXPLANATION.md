# Database Relationship Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Wrong
Your diagnostic was PERFECT! It showed exactly the issue:
- The job EXISTS in the database (Job Found: ✅ Yes)
- But the query failed with: "Could not embed because more than one relationship was found"

## 🎯 The Real Problem
This happens when you have multiple foreign keys between two tables. For example:
- `jobs` table has `proposal_id` (references proposals)
- `proposals` table has `job_id` (references jobs)
- Maybe also `job_proposals` junction table

When Supabase sees `proposals (*)` in the query, it doesn't know which relationship to follow.

## ✅ The Fix Applied
Changed the query from:
```sql
.select(`
  *,
  customers (...),
  proposals (...)  -- AMBIGUOUS!
`)
```

To:
```sql
.select(`
  *,
  customers!customer_id (...),  -- EXPLICIT: use customer_id field
`)
```

Then fetch proposal separately if needed.

## 🚀 Result
Jobs should now load properly! The issue was NOT:
- ❌ Database corruption
- ❌ Missing permissions
- ❌ Codebase problems
- ✅ Just an ambiguous query that needed clarification

## 📝 Note
This is a common Supabase gotcha when you have bidirectional relationships between tables. Always be explicit about which foreign key to use!
