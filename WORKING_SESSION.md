## üìä CURRENT WORKING STATE

### What's Working:
‚úÖ Customer proposal view - complete with all details
‚úÖ Approval process - no constraint violations
‚úÖ Payment flow - Stripe integration functional
‚úÖ Progressive unlocking - each payment unlocks next
‚úÖ Status updates - automatic and manual
‚úÖ Admin view - shows everything properly
‚úÖ UI spacing - professional and consistent

### Database Structure:
- User role: 'boss' (not 'admin')
- Customers: OBJECT not array
- Payment fields: deposit_amount, progress_payment_amount, final_payment_amount
- Payment timestamps: deposit_paid_at, progress_paid_at, final_paid_at
- Status values: draft, sent, viewed, approved, rejected (payment statuses set via API)

### Payment Flow (DO NOT MODIFY):
1. /api/create-payment - Creates Stripe session
2. /api/payment-success - Handles callback, updates DB
3. Status progression: approved ‚Üí deposit_paid ‚Üí progress_paid ‚Üí final_paid
4. See PAYMENT_ROUTING.md for complete documentation

## üö® NEXT TASK - MISSING BUTTONS

### Issue:
The admin proposal view is missing three critical buttons:
1. **"Send to Customer"** button
2. **"Edit"** button  
3. **"Create Job"** button (should function like "New Job" in Jobs section)

These buttons were previously visible but have disappeared. Need to:
- Check if they're hidden by CSS or conditional rendering
- Restore their visibility
- Ensure "Create Job" has same functionality as job creation

### Location:
Admin side proposal view: /proposals/[id]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

3. **DO NOT CHANGE**: Payment calculations (50/30/20 split)
4. **MAINTAIN**: All current functionality while adding missing buttons
5. **TEST**: Always verify builds before committing

## üîß DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

- Use Desktop Commander for file operations
- Create single .sh scripts that handle everything
- Always verify with `npm run build` before committing
