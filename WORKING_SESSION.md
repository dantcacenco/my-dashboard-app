## Critical Failures & Comprehensive Fix Plan

### THE CORE PROBLEM
I've been making piecemeal changes without understanding the complete data flow. Each "fix" breaks something else because I'm not considering the entire system.

---

## üî¥ CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Customer Proposal View is Completely Broken
**Problem**: Customer sees only title and buttons, NO proposal content
**Root Cause**: The CustomerProposalView component is missing the actual proposal display logic
**Location**: `app/proposal/view/[token]/CustomerProposalView.tsx`

### 2. Approval Fails
**Problem**: "Failed to approve proposal" error
**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect data updates in Supabase

### 3. Send Proposal Still Broken
**Problem**: "Missing required fields" error persists
**Root Cause**: API endpoint exists but isn't handling the data correctly

---

## üìä ACTUAL DATA STRUCTURE (from Supabase)

```javascript
// Proposal structure when fetched with customers
{
  id: string,
  proposal_number: string,
  customer_id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  subtotal: number,
  tax_rate: number,
  tax_amount: number,
  total: number,
  status: string,
  customers: {  // OBJECT not array
    id: string,
    name: string,
    email: string,
    phone: string,
    address: string
  },
  proposal_items: [  // ARRAY of items
    {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      description: string,
      quantity: number,
      unit_price: number,
      total_price: number,
      is_addon: boolean,
      is_selected: boolean
    }
  ],
  customer_view_token: string,
  deposit_amount: number,
  progress_payment_amount: number,
  final_payment_amount: number,
  deposit_paid_at: string | null,
  progress_paid_at: string | null,
  final_paid_at: string | null
}
```

## üîß COMPREHENSIVE FIX PLAN

### PHASE 1: Fix Customer Proposal View (URGENT)
The customer view needs to show:
1. Proposal header with number and date
2. Customer information
3. Services list with prices
4. Optional add-ons (selectable)
5. Totals (subtotal, tax, total)
6. Approve/Reject buttons (if not approved)
7. Payment stages (if approved)

**File to fix**: `app/proposal/view/[token]/CustomerProposalView.tsx`
**Must include**:
- Full proposal display logic
- Proper add-on selection
- Correct total calculations
- Working approve/reject handlers

### PHASE 2: Fix Approval Flow
**Current flow (BROKEN)**:
1. Customer clicks approve ‚Üí Error

**Correct flow**:
1. Customer selects add-ons
2. Customer clicks approve
3. Update proposal status to 'accepted'
4. Calculate payment amounts (50%, 30%, 20%)
5. Save to database
6. Refresh page to show payment stages
7. NO REDIRECT to payment

### PHASE 3: Fix Payment Flow
**After approval**:
1. Show 3 payment boxes
2. First payment active, others grayed out
3. Click "Pay Now" ‚Üí Stripe checkout
4. After payment ‚Üí Return to proposal view
5. Next payment unlocked

### PHASE 4: Fix Send Proposal
**Required**:
1. Generate token if missing
2. Update status to 'sent'
3. Send email with link
4. Show success message

---

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO (Learn from mistakes)

1. **DON'T** make partial fixes - fix the entire component
2. **DON'T** assume data structures - check actual database
3. **DON'T** redirect unnecessarily - keep user on same page
4. **DON'T** break working features while fixing others
5. **DON'T** ignore TypeScript errors

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETE CUSTOMER JOURNEY (How it SHOULD work)

1. **Boss creates proposal** ‚Üí Saves as draft
2. **Boss sends proposal** ‚Üí Email sent, status = 'sent'
3. **Customer receives email** ‚Üí Clicks link
4. **Customer views proposal** ‚Üí Sees FULL proposal with all details
5. **Customer selects add-ons** ‚Üí Totals update dynamically
6. **Customer approves** ‚Üí Page refreshes, shows payment stages
7. **Customer pays deposit** ‚Üí Stripe ‚Üí Returns to proposal
8. **Customer sees progress** ‚Üí Deposit marked paid, rough-in unlocked
9. **Progressive payments** ‚Üí Each unlocks the next
10. **All paid** ‚Üí Proposal complete

---

## üîç DATABASE FACTS (VERIFIED)

- User role: 'boss' (not 'admin')
- Customers: OBJECT not array
- Both column variants exist (use longer names):
  - `progress_payment_amount` (not `progress_amount`)
  - `final_payment_amount` (not `final_amount`)
- `payment_stages` table EXISTS

---

## üìù NEXT STEPS FOR NEW CHAT

1. **FIRST**: Fix CustomerProposalView to show ALL content
2. **SECOND**: Fix approval to work without errors
3. **THIRD**: Ensure payment flow works progressively
4. **FOURTH**: Test end-to-end flow

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] Customer can see full proposal content
- [ ] Add-ons are selectable
- [ ] Totals calculate correctly
- [ ] Approval works without errors
- [ ] Payment stages appear after approval
- [ ] Payments work progressively
- [ ] Send proposal works

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

The main issue is that CustomerProposalView was gutted and now only shows approval/payment logic, but lost all the proposal display content. The component needs to:
1. Show proposal details when status is 'sent' or 'viewed'
2. Show payment stages when status is 'accepted'
3. Handle the transition smoothly

**Critical**: The view must be complete and self-contained, not rely on redirects or external state.

---

## üö® FOR THE NEXT DEVELOPER

**START HERE**: The CustomerProposalView component is completely broken. It shows nothing but title and buttons. You need to add back ALL the proposal display logic while keeping the payment flow. Look at the data structure above and make sure every field is displayed properly.

**Remember**: 
- No partial fixes
- Test everything before committing
- Think through the entire flow
- The customer experience is broken - fix that first
